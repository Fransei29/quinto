          <span>Packaging:</span> 
          <p>After passing quality control, the ground coffee is ready for packaging. Coffee packaging involves several considerations, including packaging material, size, design, and labeling. Different packaging formats, such as bags, cans, or pods, may be used depending on consumer preferences and market trends.</p>

          <span>Sealing and Labeling:</span>
          <p>Once the ground coffee is placed in the packaging, it is sealed to preserve freshness and prevent oxidation. Sealing methods vary but often include heat sealing or vacuum sealing. Additionally, each package is labeled with essential information such as the coffee blend, roast level, expiration date, and origin.</p>

          <span>Roasting:</span> 
          <p>Following labeling, the coffee beans are subjected to the roasting process. During roasting, the coffee beans are heated to specific temperatures and roasted to develop their characteristic flavor and aroma. Roasting also affects the color of the beans, ranging from light roast to dark roast. This stage is crucial in determining the flavor profile of the coffee.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
          <span>Grinding:</span>
          <p>Once roasted, the coffee beans are ground into smaller particles to increase the surface area and allow for efficient extraction of flavors during brewing. The grind size can vary depending on the brewing method, with different methods requiring different coarseness or fineness of the grind</p>
