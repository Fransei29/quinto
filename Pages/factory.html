    <span>Selection and purchase of green coffee:</span> 
    <p>This step involves the selection and purchase of high-quality green coffee beans. Factory buyers typically source coffee beans from various regions worldwide that meet desired standards of quality and flavor. The quality of the green coffee is crucial for producing a good final product.</p>
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="Second">
      <span>Quality Assessment :</span> 
      <p>Once potential sources of green coffee beans are identified, quality assessment becomes a crucial aspect of the selection process. Buyers often evaluate factors such as bean size, density, moisture content, and defects to ensure they meet quality standards. They may also consider other factors like altitude, soil quality, and processing methods, which can influence flavor profiles.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="Third">
      <span>Sample Evaluation:</span> 
      <p>Before making large purchases, buyers often request samples of green coffee beans from potential suppliers. These samples are roasted and cupped (tasted) to assess their flavor, aroma, acidity, and overall quality. Cupping involves a systematic tasting process where trained professionals evaluate different aspects of the coffee's flavor profile.</p>
